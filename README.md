# KFTurbo

Killing Floor Turbo is a balance overhaul mod for Killing Floor that also adds some QoL features.

## Balance
KFTurbo's goal is to take underused perks and weapons and bring them inline with the competency of established weapons in the meta by either improving them or reworking them to make them more viable during high difficulty gameplay. When balancing, KFTurbo considers the M14 LAR Sharpshooter and M32 M79 Demolitions as the baseline to compare other perks and loadouts against. Weapons that are considered too strong or cause boring gameplay have been nerfed (such as the Crossbow), or removed (such as the ZED guns).

## Special Game Modes
KFTurbo contains the following special challenge modes:
* Killing Floor Turbo+
* [Killing Floor Card Game](https://github.com/KFPilot/KFTurbo/tree/master/KFTurboCardGame#readme)
