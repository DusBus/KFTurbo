# KFTurbo+

KFTurbo+ is the high difficulty game mode of KFTurbo. Scrakes and Fleshpounds spawn in earlier waves and ramp up in numbers faster. Spawn rates as well as the maximum numbers of zeds on the map at once are increased. Players start with increased cash and trading can be done anywhere on the map during trader waves.

## Key Features:
- **Difficulty**: Designed to challenge players, while remaining beatable.
  - **Early Tough Enemies**: Scrakes and Fleshpounds appear in early waves and quickly increase in numbers.
  - **Zed Density**: More zeds are present on the map at once.
  - **Fast-Paced Spawns**: zeds spawn at a high rate.
- **Increased Starting Cash**: Players start with enough cash to afford their loadouts right from the start.
- **Pre-Game Trading**: The game begins with a trader wave instead of directly starting with Wave 1.
- **Trade Anywhere**: Players can trade from anywhere on the map during trader waves (default key: H).
- **Shortened Trader Wave**: The trader phase is reduced to 45 seconds.
